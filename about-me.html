								<h2>Personal Story</h2>
								<p>
									Hello! <br> <p style="text-indent: 4em;">My name is Kevin Barrios. I am a full-stack software engineer with a drive and eagerness for web development. I enjoy learning ways to make code work more efficiently, finding patterns, and connecting it all together to form a powerful creation.</p>
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									I'm a programmer by day and a musician by night. I learned how to play piano by ear by replicating melodies, harmonies, and covering songs. Within two years, I won a piano competition held in high school. I played a rendition of <em>Lux Aeterna</em> by Clint Mansell from the 2000 film <em>Requiem For A Dream</em>. I followed my passion for music by attending Columbia College in Chicago, majoring in music theory, composition, and performance. At Columbia, I participated in collaborations with other artists as well as performed in live shows and recordings. My exposure to music allowed me to master teamwork, discipline, and repetition, all of which I used extensively throughout my journey while learning to program.
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									For the past few years, I was a banker for JPMorgan Chase. I gained a wealth of knowledge about the financial industry and honed my skills in leadership, communication, and problem-solving. The dynamic environment enabled me to excel in my role, granting me responsibilities ranging from supervisor to collateral management, notary public, and small business specialist. I learned how to adapt to fast-paced environments, analyze sensitive data, abstract complex issues, and simplify procedures for clients to understand. These skills were beneficial for my transition into software engineering by applying those abilities to develop instinctive and user-friendly software applications.
								</p>
								<h2>Journey In Programming</h2>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									Anyone that knows me is well aware that I love technology. I take advantage of every opportunity I get to use it. For instance, I have a Google home set up to where I can say, “Hey Google, make the lights blue” and it will do it. I can also obtain access to my home PC from my phone to acquire files that are stored locally, or even use Samsung Dex on my phone to have a laptop wherever I go. I am eager to try out new technology. I always wanted to be further connected to it and figured that web development would be the perfect way for me to explore it.
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									My experience with web development has been fulfilling. I recently completed a 48-week software engineering program at App Academy where I learned various web development skills including JavaScript, Python, Object Oriented programming, and so much more. I worked on solo projects, group projects, and accumulated over 500 hours of pair-programming sessions. I built three full-stack applications by modeling the foundation of the backend, shaping the frontend with React-Redux, designing the CSS, and integrating AWS for cloud storage and Docker for easy deployment. It’s like writing a song where you decide what chords you want to play, and then creatively express those chords with melodies and lyrics. Now that I have completed my first step in web development, I look forward to expanding my knowledge and skill set to create more exciting and intuitive features. While one year ago I used to wonder how I could develop an application, now I ask myself, what else I can build?
								</p>
								<h2>TLDR</h2>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									As a self-taught musician, I found that it took patience, dedication, and repetition to learn a complicated piece of music. My experience working in banking taught me to be methodical and efficient in a fast-paced work environment, simplifying complicated procedures and being very thorough with my work. I was able to bring the two together in programming, demonstrating my commitment to learning and succeeding in the development field. While technology keeps growing every day, my passion for tech continues to grow, too. I’m excited to see what the future holds for technology, and I’m glad to be a part of it.
