								<h2>Personal Story</h2>
								<p>
									Hello! <br> <p style="text-indent: 4em;">My name is Kevin Barrios. I am a full-stack software engineer with a drive and eagerness for web development. I enjoy learning ways to make code work more efficiently, finding patterns, and connecting it all together to form a powerful creation.</p>
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									I'm a programmer by day and a musician by night. I learned how to play piano by listening to songs and finding the same pitches on the keyboard. I would replicate melodies, harmonies, and ultimately I found myself covering songs. Within two years of playing, I won a piano competition held at my high school. I played a rendition of <em>Lux Aeterna</em> by Clint Mansell from the 2000 film <em>Requiem For A Dream</em>. I followed my passion for music by attending Columbia College in Chicago, majoring in music theory, composition, and performance. During this time, I have had the opportunity to participate in collaborations with other artists as well as perform live shows and recordings. My exposure to music allowed me to see a wide range of diversity and creativity from artists with all kinds of backgrounds. It was art coming to life.
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									For the past few years, I was a banker for JPMorgan Chase. I gained a wealth of knowledge about the financial industry and enjoyed interacting with customers. The location I worked in was very busy seeing around 150 - 200 customers daily. The engaging environment allowed me to excel in my role granting me responsibilities ranging from supervisor to collateral management, notary public, and small business specialist; developing skills in leadership, communication, planning, and organization. Outside of work, I dedicated time to furthering my comprehension of the financial world and used that knowledge to help my clients. This included ways to build credit, save money to buy a home, or even open someone’s first bank account. With clients coming from various backgrounds, I often used my understanding of Spanish and French to make sure they feel welcomed.
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									Working at Chase taught me an invaluable set of skills. Most importantly, I learned how to work well in fast-paced environments, abstract complex issues, and simplify procedures that are easy for clients to understand. A priceless set of skills that I take everywhere I go.
								</p>
								<h2>Journey In Programming</h2>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									Anyone that knows me is well aware that I love technology. I take advantage of every opportunity I get to use it. For instance, I have a Google home set up to where I can say, “Hey Google, make the lights blue” and it will do it. I can also obtain access to my home PC from my phone to acquire files that are stored locally, or even use Samsung Dex on my phone to have a laptop wherever I go. I am eager to try out new technology. I always wanted to be further connected to it and figured that web development would be the perfect way for me to explore it.
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									My experience with web development has been very exciting. I joined App Academy’s comprehensive 48-week software engineering program, where I was taught JavaScript, Python, CSS, Object Oriented programming, data structures and algorithms, time and space complexity, RESTFUL APIs, and much more. During the program, I worked on solo projects, group projects, and accumulated over 500 hours of pair-programming sessions. I built three full-stack applications from the backend to frontend, applying CSS from scratch, and integrated AWS for cloud storage and Docker for easy deployment. My favorite part of creating an application is writing out the backend intricacies and developing JSX with React on the frontend. It’s like writing a song where you decide what chords you want to play, and then creatively express those chords with melodies and lyrics. Now that I have completed my first step in web development, I look forward to expanding my knowledge and skill set to create more exciting and intuitive features. While one year ago I used to wonder how I could develop an application, now I ask myself, what else I can build?
								</p>
								<h2>TLDR</h2>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									As a self-taught musician, I found that it took patience, dedication, and repetition to learn a complicated piece of music. My experience working in banking taught me to be methodical and efficient in a fast-paced work environment, simplifying complicated procedures and being very thorough with my work. I was able to bring the two together in programming, demonstrating my commitment to learning and succeeding in the development field. While technology keeps growing every day, my passion for tech continues to grow, too. I’m excited to see what the future holds for technology, and I’m glad to be a part of it.
