								<h2>Personal Story</h2>
								<p>
									Hello! <br> <p style="text-indent: 4em;">My name is Kevin Barrios. I am a full-stack software engineer with a drive and eagerness for web development. I enjoy learning ways to make code work more efficiently, finding patterns, and connecting it all together to form a wonderful creation.</p>
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									Outside of programming, I am a musician. I taught myself how to play the piano by listening to songs and finding the same intonation on the keyboard. I began replicating melodies, harmonies, to covering songs and writing a few songs of my own. Within two years of playing, I won a piano competition held in my high school where I played a rendition of <em>Lux Aeterna</em> by Clint Mansell from the 2000 film <em>Requiem For A Dream</em>. I followed my passion for music by attending Columbia College in Chicago, majoring in music theory, composition, and performance. I have participated in collaborations, live performances, and recordings. My exposure to music allowed me to see a wide range of diversity and creativity from artists with all kinds of backgrounds. It was art coming to life.
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									For the past few years, I have been working as a banker for Chase bank. I gained a wealth of knowledge about the financial industry and enjoyed interacting with customers. I would dedicate time outside of work to further my knowledge of the financial world and used that knowledge to help out my clients. That included ways to build credit, save money to buy a home, or even open up someone’s first bank account. My location was very busy as it saw around 100 - 200 customers daily. And since I was working in a very engaging environment, it allowed me to quickly become proficient with many procedures. That granted me a plethora of responsibilities ranging from a supervisor, collateral management, notary public, small business specialist, and translator for Spanish-speaking clients, with occasionally needing to use my slight knowledge in French, too. Working at Chase taught me how to work well in a fast-paced environment, break down complex issues, and simplify procedures for clients to understand. Invaluable skills that I will take everywhere I go.
								</p>
								<h2>Journey In Programming</h2>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									Anyone that knows me well enough knows that I love technology and I use it every time I can. For example, I have a Google home setup where I can say “Hey, Google, turn the lights blue”, or when I can obtain remote access to my home computer using my phone, or even use my phone’s Samsung Dex system to have a laptop on the go. Essentially, I love to play around with technology. I have always wanted to connect further with technology and I figured that web development would be a great path for me to explore most of it.
								</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									My journey into web development has been fulfilling. I joined App Academy’s 48-week full-stack software engineering program. There, I learned about JavaScript, Python, CSS, Object Oriented Programming, data structures and algorithms, time and space complexity, RESTFUL APIs, and the list goes on. I devoted my free time to studying as each week presented new material which required having a thorough understanding to pass weekly assessments. I successfully completed the program without a single exam failure. And sure, studying may have cost me a bit of my social life, but completing the program on time is a reward in itself. I developed three full-stack applications. Two of them I completed on my own and the other one I worked on in a group. My favorite features about building an application have been writing out the intricacies of the backend and developing JSX using React on the frontend. One year ago I kept asking myself, "how can I create a website?" Now I ask myself, "what else can I create?" I’m excited to find out.
								</p>
								<h2>TLDR</h2>
								<p style="text-indent: 4em;">
									As a self-taught musician, I learned that it requires patience, discipline, and repetition to acquire skills for learning a complex section of music. As a banker, simplifying complicated procedures and working in a fast-paced environment allowed me to be very thorough with my work. I’ve been able to combine both fields into programming and incorporated them in my programming journey, demonstrating perseverance to learn and prosper in a development field. As technology keeps growing every day, my curiosity for technology grows, too. I’m excited to see what the future holds for technology, and I’m glad to be a part of it.
